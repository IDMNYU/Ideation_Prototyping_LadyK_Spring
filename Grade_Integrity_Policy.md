## Grade Integrity & Non-Negotiation Policy

### Grades in this course reflect documented process, engagement, and completion of required work as defined in the syllabus and rubrics.

### Grades are not negotiable.

	Requests to raise grades, reconsider scores, or make exceptions outside of established policies will not be considered.

### All grading decisions are based on:

	Published rubrics

	Documented work submitted by deadlines

	Evidence of process, iteration, and engagement

### What Grade Discussions Are Appropriate

Students may request:

	Clarification of how a grade was calculated

	Explanation of rubric criteria

	Guidance on how to improve future work

These conversations must focus on forward progress, not retroactive changes.

### What Grade Discussions Are Not Appropriate

The following will not be engaged with:

	Requests for grade increases without new or missing work

	Appeals based on effort, intent, stress, workload, or circumstances not previously communicated

	Comparisons to other students’ grades

	Requests framed as “just a few points,” “rounding up,” or “being close”

	Repeated follow-ups after a decision has been communicated

### Timing & Documentation

	Grade questions must be raised within one week of grades being posted.

	All grade-related discussions must reference specific rubric criteria.

	Work submitted late or missing required components cannot be regraded for a higher score.

### Late Work & Feedback Policy

	Feedback is provided based on work submitted by the stated deadlines.

	Late work is reviewed the following week and may impact your Process Site and participation grades.

	Feedback is non-retroactive. There are no grade adjustments based on later improvements.

	There is no mechanism for revisiting past grades once feedback has been given and the course has moved forward.

## Attempts to negotiate grades, pressure for exceptions, or bypass stated policies undermine fairness and will not be entertained.
