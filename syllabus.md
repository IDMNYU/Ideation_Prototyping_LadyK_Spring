## Welcome to Ideation &amp; Prototyping!

In this course, the creative process is examined as a method for developing ideas, rather than a means to arrive quickly at a final outcome. Through ideation, design research, critical thinking, and prototyping, students will learn how iterative processes, experimentation, and failure can add depth, complexity, and rigor to work across art, design, technology, and business contexts.

Students will expand their toolkit of design research strategies and learn how to critically evaluate assumptions about audience, content, form, and systems. Emphasis is placed on exploring multiple approaches to problem framing, resisting default solutions, and using research and feedback to transform ideas over time. The course prioritizes process, iteration, and reflection as essential components of meaningful creative practice.

### PROGRAM GOALS

The following Integrated Digital Media program goals are introduced and reinforced within this course. Students will:

*   develop conceptual thinking skills to generate ideas and content in order to solve problems or create opportunities.
*   develop documentation and reflection skills and techniques to strengthen their process.
*   develop a research and studio practice through inquiry and iteration.
*   develop critical thinking skills that will allow one to analyze and position their work within cultural, historical, aesthetic, economic, and technological contexts.
*   develop collaboration skills to actively and effectively work in a team or group.

[Back To The Top](#Syllabus-Short-Cuts)

### COURSE GOALS

To get students to:

*   develop a rigorous, iterative process for looking, questioning, thinking, making, and communicating that challenges assumptions and preconceived ideas
*   use their imagination to create something entirely new &amp; innovative OR to reinvent an old idea into something new
*   introduce students to the many research &amp; design methodologies available to them
*   develop skills of description, research, analysis, visualization, design and critical thinking.
*   improve writing, documentation, and presentation skills
*   facilitate collaboration
*  understand what it means to develop a practice, which indicates development strides of leaps and bounds, unforeseen at the onset of the process
*  take risks and experiment; developing a healthy sense of curiosity

[Back To The Top](#Syllabus-Short-Cuts)

### LEARNING OUTCOMES

By the end of this course students should be able to:

*   to search and spot ideas, and transform these invisible ideas into visible realizations

[Back To The Top](#Syllabus-Short-Cuts)

### COURSE STRUCTURE

The course will be comprised of lectures, critiques, discussions, readings, screenings, exercises, mini-projects and an overall project.

Feedback sessions and critiques are the best way to articulate your ideas to others and get immediate feedback. The class analyzes and suggests ways to increase the impact of your project. The feedback is about how the work is coming across as well as ways to expand it. It is not about you personally, but your work.

Feedback is a shared responsibility. You will receive feedback from:

* Peers (structured, required, and graded)

* The instructor (rotating, focused, and targeted)

* Yourself (through required process analysis)

Learning to give and use feedback is a core outcome of this course.

### Time Estimate Per Week for Homework - Asynchronous Learning Time

These are ball-park time estimates for various homework assignments given in this course. These estimates will vary per student, as they also will throughout the semester. In the beginning of the semester, the time will be spread across the assignments. As various assignments wrap up towards the end of the semester, that time will then be required to be dedicated towards The Future project. 

Please manage your time and do. not. do. your. homework. in. one. sitting. It will be stressful and not quality work. You may POST your homework before the deadline. Infact, you are encouraged to! Students who spread the assignment across the week submit higher quality work under less stress, and work with greater ease. Please note that doing to work is different from posting the work. As such, the time estimate has been included below:

* Time Management - 15-25 minutes
* Prototyping; Design Exercises; News Research; Future Project - 60-180 minutes
* Updating Blog with documentation of work and written Design Autopsy/Failure Report - 30-90 minutes
* Readings from required books and links - 40 - 60 minutes

[Back To The Top](#Syllabus-Short-Cuts)

### Design Autopsy/Failure Reports

* Given each exercise (whether in class or for homework), students are required to post the documentation of those exercises and post a Design Autopsy/Failure Report. Writing in this course is not about sounding smart or polished. It is about analyzing your own thinking. This is to include the following: 

   * Name your confusions and describe them

   * Identify missteps

   * Trace how decisions were made

   * Explain how feedback or research changed your direction

Specificity matters more than polish. Messy thinking is expected.

[Back To The Top](#Syllabus-Short-Cuts)


### Student Responsibilities

This course depends on your active engagement with process, not passive completion of tasks. The responsibilities below exist to support your learning, your peers’ learning, and the experimental nature of the course.

Please see the student [FAQ's](studentFAQ.md) Frequenly Asked Questions

##### Presence & Engagement

* Be present and focused during class. This means no multitasking and no device use unless explicitly part of an activity.

* Take notes. You are responsible for understanding what is discussed in class.

* Arrive on time and stay engaged for the full duration of class.

* Participation includes asking questions, contributing to discussions, and engaging in critiques—not just submitting assignments.

* If you have a question, someone else likely does too. Vocalizing questions helps everyone. This course only works if you lean in.

##### Time, Work Habits & Self-Management

* Devote a minimum of 5 hours per week of well-organized time outside of class for assignments, readings, and process work. Some students may need more.

* Do not complete assignments in one sitting or the night before they are due. This course is built around iteration.

* Start work early to allow time for confusion, feedback, and revision.

* Maintain a calendar and manage your time intentionally.

* Get sufficient sleep. Maintain a proper diet. Fatigue undermines creative thinking.

##### Assignments, Process & Documentation

* Complete all assignments and post them to your Process Site by the stated deadlines (typically Saturday at 9:00am EST unless otherwise noted).

* Your process site should show thinking over time, including false starts, abandoned ideas, changes in direction, and your Design Autopsy/Failure Report.

Participation is not limited to what you turn in—how you arrive there matters. Talk about this.

##### Feedback & Collaboration

* Give your classmates constructive, engaged feedback. Do not be passive in critiques.

* Feedback is a required part of your participation grade.

* Do not take critique personally. The goal is to push ideas further, including your own.

* Be open to having your assumptions challenged.

* Learning how to give and receive feedback is a core skill in this course.

##### Reading & Research

* Acquire and complete all assigned readings before they are due.

* Read actively and critically. These materials are intended to challenge and expand your thinking—not simply provide information.

##### Mindset & Approach

You are expected to:

* Take risks and be willing to fail

* Be patient with ambiguity and uncertainty

* Persist through confusion and revision

* Strive for continuous improvement

* Pay attention to detail and craft over time

* Be creative—there are many forms of creativity; find yours

* Bring curiosity and enthusiasm to learning and exploration

Your best will vary from day to day. That is normal.
What matters is honest effort, engagement, and growth.

##### Final Expectation

This course rewards process, experimentation, and transformation. Avoid playing it safe. Avoid perfectionism. Avoid rushing to answers.

Show up. Try things. Get it wrong. Take risks. Learn from it.

And yes—have fun.

[Back To The Top](#Syllabus-Short-Cuts)

### Attendance

* If you find yourself in the situation where you can not come to class, for WHATEVER REASON, you are still responsible for the course material. All assignments are still due on time. If you need accommodations, you must communicate with me as well as the Coordinator of Student Advocacy and Compliance office at (eng.studentadvocate@nyu.edu & deanna.rayment@nyu.edu, 646.997.3046).
* Attendance is mandatory. I will discuss how to do the assignments and my expectations. Since there is so much technical, conceptual, and design information to absorb, regular attendance is essential. I cannot stress this enough. You must attend class to ensure that you are understanding how to work. I cover how to do the assignments in class, when they are assigned.
* Unexcused absences will affect your grade, after 3 of them. 
* 5 or more unexcused absenses is grounds to be dismissed from the course or failing the coure.
* Feedback sessions cannot be made up.
* Be on Time. Tardiness will affect your grade. For every 3 tardies (15 minutes or more), you accrue an un excused absence. See above
* Contact the professor IN ADVANCE if you will not be in class (via direct message on slack is preferred).
* Attendance is mandatory for the midterm and final presentations / critiques. No exceptions. Critiques can not be made up.
* Work is still due on due dates, regardless of whether you are in class or not.
* Material missed is the responsibility of the student to make up. Consult the syllabus & schedule & github & slack. Speak to other classmates in order to find out what was discussed. Speak to several of them and at length. Office hours ARE NOT for making up lost class time.
* If you have some extenuating need to be outside of class (special doctor's appointment, religious observations, medical issues, COVID issues, etc etc), please let me know ASAP AND contact the Coordinator of Student Advocacy and Compliance at (eng.studentadvocate@nyu.edu, 646.997.3046). A note that office will excuse the absence.

### Communication

These policies exist to ensure fairness, clarity, and a productive learning environment for everyone.

Clear, professional communication and respect for boundaries are required in this course.

#### Approved Communication Channels

* Slack Direct Message is the preferred method of contact.

* Email should be used only for time-sensitive matters.

* Messages will be responded to within 24–48 hours, Monday–Friday.

* No responses will be sent on weekends or holidays.

#### Appropriate Use of Asynchronous Communication

* Slack and email are for logistics only (when, where, deadlines, submission issues).

* Messages must be professional in tone and content at all times.

* Unprofessional or inappropriate messages will not be engaged with.

#### Issues, Concerns, or Problems

* Substantive issues, concerns, or ongoing problems must be discussed in person during class or office hours.

* Do not attempt to resolve complex issues through Slack or email.

* If a message exceeds a short paragraph, you will be asked to schedule a meeting.

* Messages consisting of multiple paragraphs or repeated follow-ups will receive a response requesting an in-person meeting only.

#### Boundaries

* Continuous back-and-forth messaging is not appropriate and will not be tolerated.

* Sending multiple messages within a short time frame is considered unprofessional and will not be engaged with.

#### Feedback & Deadlines

* Weekly feedback is addressed in class and is based on new content posted to your Process Site by Saturday at 10:00am.

* Work submitted after the deadline will be reviewed the following week and counted as late.

* Late work affects your progress and Process Site grade.

*  Feedback is forward-moving. There are no retroactive revisions.

#### Course Materials

* Students are responsible for regularly checking the GitHub repository and Slack workspace for assignments, resources, and course updates.

* Course materials are available at all times.

[Back To The Top](#Syllabus-Short-Cuts)

#### Grading

Grades in this course are based on documented process and intellectual growth, not correctness or polish. You are evaluated on how your thinking develops over time, not on whether an idea “works” on the first attempt.

Students are expected to demonstrate continuous improvement through research, iteration, and engagement with feedback. Work that remains static, underdeveloped, or resistant to feedback will not earn a satisfactory grade.

Depth, risk-taking, and visible evolution are required. Failure to show meaningful development across the semester will result in a below satisfactory grade.

   >I don’t grade where your work ends up—I grade how much it moves, how deeply it develops, and how well you engage with feedback along the way.

Please also see [Grade Integrity Policy](Grade_Integrity_Policy.md)

##### Quantitative Grading Breakdown

*   10% Class participation: discussion and feedback of your peers, cognitive presence in class, discussion of your work and challenges, your activity within the class community inside and outside of class
*   5% [Self Assessments](self_assessments.md) (2.5% each)
*   25%  [The Iterative Object Project](IterativeObjectProject.md
*   20% [Process Website](processWebsite.md), including all written reflections for ALL posts, including time Management, Class exercises, Article reflections
*   10%  [Future Artifact]("/assignmentBriefs/Artifact_Tool.md")
*   20% [Future Project Development](Future.md) 
*   10% Project Final Presentation + Process

##### Qualitative Grading Overview

##### A. Excellent (90-100: Work of exceptional quality; Exceeds Expectations)
Performance, participation, and attendance of the student has been of the highest level, showing sustained excellence in meeting course responsibilities. Work clearly differentiates itself from other work, has memorable impact, pursues concepts and techniques above and beyond what is discussed in class. The student thoroughly understands the theory and practice behind ideation &amp; prototyping.

##### B. Very Good / Good (80-89: Work of high quality)
Performance, participation, and attendance of the student has been good, though not of the highest level. Work demonstrates a better than average understanding of ideation &amp; prototyping theory & practice.

##### C. Satisfactory (70-79: Average; Satisfies course requirements)
Performance and attendance of the student has been adequate, satisfactorily meeting the course requirements. Work is average and competent, showing a basic understanding of ideation &amp; prototyping theory & practice.

##### D. Poor; Below Average (60-69: Deficient, but passing)
Performance and attendance of the student has been less than adequate. Work is lacking in many or most areas that show any understanding of ideation &amp; prototyping. Problems may include lack of interest, procrastination, poor planning and poor craft.

##### F. Unacceptable (59 & Below: Failing Course Requirements)
Performance and attendance of the student has been such that course requirements have not been met. Work shows no overall understanding of the course material on many levels or either a severe lack of interest. 


[Back To The Top](#Syllabus-Short-Cuts)

### Using Generative AI

If a student chooses to use AI or generative software in this course, its use must be fully disclosed and documented.

Students are required to:

   1. Explain why AI was used

   2. Describe how it was used

   3. Include screenshots of the entire interaction, from prompt to output

This requirement applies to all forms of AI involvement, including (but not limited to):

* Idea generation

* Writing suggestions

* Editing or restructuring

* Research assistance

* Image, text, or code generation
Whether the AI contribution is direct or indirect, it must be documented.

All submitted work must remain in the student’s own voice and demonstrate thoughtful engagement, depth, and clear evolution of ideas. AI may support the process, but it may not replace critical thinking, authorship, or reflection.

Coursework submitted without the required disclosure, discussion, and documentation will be considered a violation of the [NYU Student Code of Conduct](https://engineering.nyu.edu/life-tandon/student-life/student-advocacy/student-code-conduct#chapter-id-34265).

#### Acceptable Use

Appropriate use of AI includes:

* Collaborating with AI as a thinking partner to explore ideas

* Using AI as a starting point for research or inquiry

* Using AI to help surface questions, not answers

All such use must be documented on the student’s Process Site.

#### Unacceptable Use

AI may not be used to:

* Finalize assignments or written submissions

* Replace original analysis, reflection, or decision-making

* Serve as an authoritative information source

Students are responsible for verifying all AI-generated content. Any errors, inaccuracies, or hallucinations produced by AI are the student’s responsibility.

##### AI may assist your process, but it may not do your thinking for you.

[Back To The Top](#Syllabus-Short-Cuts)

### Special Notes about this course: 
   * ** Multi-Week Projects & Evaluation **

      * Several projects in this course develop over multiple weeks and are assessed on a week-to-week basis. Each submission is evaluated in relation to the previous week, with emphasis on movement, iteration, and decision-making over time.

      * Work is evaluated based on evidence of thinking, not correctness or final outcomes. Evidence of thinking includes:

      * Posted reflections that analyze decisions and changes

      * Clearly documented visual materials with annotations

      * Research that meaningfully influences direction

      * Visible pivots, refinements, or re-framing of ideas

      Projects that do not show ongoing development and substantive change across weeks will receive a below satisfactory evaluation, regardless of the final presentation.

       **Strong work evolves continuously. It is not “fixed” at the end.**

   * **This course is built around work that develops over time. Time between working sessions is part of the process. As a result, cramming is ineffective and will not produce satisfactory outcomes.**

   * **Assignments are not checklists. Work completed in compressed time frames cannot replicate the thinking, iteration, and development expected in this course. This is not a course that can be “caught up” at the end.**

   * **Students who distribute their work across the week—rather than completing it the night before—consistently demonstrate stronger development and perform better in the course. Breaks and distance from the work are productive. Last-minute work is not.**

   * **Grades are based on submitted work. The lowest possible grade for submitted work is an F. If no work is submitted for assessment, the grade is 0.**

### Technology in the Classroom

   Being physically present but mentally absent is the same as not participating.

Laptop computers and mobile devices are essential tools for creative work when used intentionally. They are also a major source of distraction. Because this course relies on discussion, critique, and collective thinking, presence and attention are required.

During class, devices may be used only for activities directly related to the course, including:

* Taking notes

* Researching material relevant to class discussions

* Working on in-class assignments

* Making class presentations

The following uses are not permitted during class:

* Email

* Messaging or texting

* Social media

* Non-course-related browsing

During screenings, talks, or critiques, laptops and devices must be closed unless otherwise instructed.

Chronic device use that interferes with participation will impact your participation grade. Students who are disengaged may be called upon to re-enter the discussion.

This class functions as a community. Individual distraction affects collective learning.


[Back To The Top](#Syllabus-Short-Cuts)

### ACADEMIC Integrity

Violations of academic integrity are considered to be acts of academic dishonesty and include (but are not limited to) cheating, plagiarizing, fabrication, denying other access to information or material, and facilitating academic dishonesty, and are subject to the policies and procedures noted in the Student Handbook and within the Course Catalog, including the Student Code of Conduct and the Student Judicial System.  Please note that lack of knowledge of citations procedures, for example, is an unacceptable explanation for plagiarism, as is having studied together to produce remarkable similar papers or creative works submitted separately by two students, or recycling work from a previous class.

Please review <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/about/policies-guidelines-compliance/policies-and-guidelines/academic-integrity-for-students-at-nyu.html">NYU's School of Engineering's academic dishonesty policy</a> in its entirety.  Procedures may include, but are not limited to: failing the assignment, failing the course, going in front of an academic judicial council and possible suspension from school.  Violations will not be tolerated.

All work for this class must be your own and specific to this semester. Any work recycled from other classes or from another, non-original source will be rejected with serious implications for the student. Plagiarism, knowingly representing the words or ideas of another as one’s own work in any academic exercise, is absolutely unacceptable. Any student who commits plagiarism must re-do the assignment for a grade no higher than a D. In fact, a D is the highest possible course grade for any student who commits plagiarism. Please use the MLA style for citing and documenting source material.   

[Back To The Top](#Syllabus-Short-Cuts)
