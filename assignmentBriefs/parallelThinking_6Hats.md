# Parallel Thinking: 6 Hats

Parallel Thinking is a tool to shift ones thinking and to think in different ways.

For the situation or problem, consider the different hats as different perspectives on the problem. What might each suggest? Document the questions, sentiments, and remarks for each.

How do they help your thinking of the situation or problem? Think of this as a discussion tool, that is solution orientated.

Start with the Blue Hat and consider the proper sequencing the hats should be worn in. Perhaps some hats are worn multiple times.


* White - Objective - facts and figures
* Red - Emotions - emotional
* Black - Evaluation - Devils Advocate, critical thinking, careful, cautious
* Yello - Sunny - Positive, What's good about this?
* Green - Growth, new ideas
* Blue - Like the sky - Above all others - the organizing hat, which hat should be worn and in what order?
