### DM-UY 1143 Ideation and Prototyping


# [Future Artifact](Artifact_Tool.md) 10% of Final Grade

As part of your Future Project, you are to design and fabricate a physical artifact that exists within the future world you have been developing.

This artifact is not a standalone product. It is evidence of your future world—something that could plausibly be found, used, circulated, repaired, archived, or discarded within it.

The goal of this assignment is to materialize your speculative future and use physical making as a way to test assumptions, reveal gaps, and deepen the logic of your world.

* A Future Artifact might be:

* A tool, device, or object used in daily life

* A system component (part of something larger)

* A cultural object (ritual item, consumer product, instructional object)

* A bureaucratic or institutional artifact

* A repair, hack, or workaround rather than a polished object

The artifact should only make sense in the future you’ve designed.

### Expectations

This is not a full iterative object design project.

You are not expected to:

	* Engineer a fully functional device

	* Produce a refined or perfect object

	* Solve every technical detail

You are expected to:

	* Make a physical thing

	* Ground it in research and world logic

	* Use making to think, test, and clarify your future

Low-fidelity is acceptable. Conceptual rigor is required.

### Process Requirements

You must document the development of your artifact on your Process Site. This includes:

1. Artifact Framing

	* What is this object?

	* Who uses it?

	* Why does it exist in your future?

	* What problem, need, or condition does it respond to?

2. Ideation & Exploration

	* Sketches, mind maps, or diagrams

	* At least 1-2 alternate direction(2) you considered and abandoned or advanced

	* Notes on assumptions you discovered or challenged

3. Material & Form Decisions

	* Why these materials?

	* Why this scale, form, or construction?

	* What tradeoffs did you make?

4. Physical Artifact

	* A fabricated object (low- to mid-fidelity)

	* May include mixed media, found objects, soft materials, rough fabrication, etc.

	* The artifact must exist in physical space (not purely digital)

5. Reflection

	* How did making this object change your understanding of your future world?

	* What new questions did it raise?

	* What would you iterate next if time permitted?

### Submission - Week 14/15

Process documentation on your Process Site

A short reflection connecting the artifact back to your Future Project

### Future Artifact Grading Rubric (10%)

The artifact is successful if it makes your future world more believable—not more polished.

1. Conceptual Alignment (40%)

	* Artifact clearly belongs to the future world

	* Object reflects systems, values, or constraints of that world

	* The artifact deepens or complicates the Future Project

High: Object reveals new insight about the future

Low: Object feels decorative or generic

2. Process & Decision-Making (30%)

	* Evidence of ideation and exploration

	* Clear articulation of choices and tradeoffs

	* Reflection demonstrates learning through making

High: Making is used as a thinking tool

Low: Object appears without explanation

3. Physical Realization (20%)

	* Object exists physically

	* Craft supports the concept (even if rough)

	* Materials and form are intentional

High: Form reinforces meaning

Low: Form is arbitrary or rushed

4. Documentation & Communication (10%)

	* Process Site documentation is clear and organized

	* Artifact is photographed and annotated

	* Reflection connects artifact to the broader Future Project



### Resources

- Use the [Crazy Eight Exercise](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVI-siAKA=/?share_link_id=441850070749) to help you think of options. Continue with a mindmap to develop

- Sketch your idea out, in many forms and perspectives

- Create a low-fi 3D model. Think: simple supplies: stuff around the house/recycling bin + hot glue gun + exacto knife, string, cardboard, legos, tissues, paper, tape

- Create a higher-fi model OR several Technical Drawings

Through each of these stages, document your PROCESS. Reflect on how it went. What did you learn and/or discover? What has changed? What difficulties did you encounter?
