### DM-UY 1143  Ideation and Prototyping

# Iterative Object Project

#### Project Goal

This project is graded on evidence of thinking. *NOT* correctness. Students will demonstrate iterative design thinking through multiple physical prototypes informed by reflection and user feedback.

> This object is not expected to succeed. It is expected to change.

> This project teaches you how to think in objects. The Future Project will ask what kind of world would produce these objects?

#### Requirements

* The object must not work
* It must change at least once after the first build
* Documentation of your process is more important than the final form

#### Constraints
* Must be physical
* Must be hand-built (no outsourcing, no final polish expectations)
* Must go through at least 3 materially different versions
* Final object may be incomplete or non-functional
* Documentation & Design Autopsy of each stage is required and heavily graded

#### Choose on of these prompts to use over the next several weeks:

* [The Useless-but-Revealing Object](/assignmentBriefs/IterativeObject_Details.md/#The-Useless-but-Revealing-Object)
	* Purpose: Break optimization instince + introduce "why does this exist?"
* [The Emotionl Machine](assignmentBriefs/IterativeObject_Details.md/#The-Emotional-Machine)
	* Purpose: Shift from technical function to experential impact
* [The Object That Trains You](assignmentBriefs/IterativeObject_Details.md/#The-Object-That-Trains-You)
	* Purpose: Introduce behavior-shaping systems

#### Structure

##### Week 1 - Prompt & First Build (Fast + Wrong)
* Goal: Break perfectionism immediately & identify a behavior, feeling or interaction the object explores.
* Restrictions: 
	* 30-45 minute rapid build using limited materials
	* No planning beyond a 5-minute sketch
* Design Autopsy:
	* What assumptions did you make?
	* What failed immediately?
	* What surprised you?

##### Week 2 - Failure as Data
* Goal: Teach observation and reinterpreation
* Assignment:
	* Test Prototype v1 with at lease 2 users
	* Document misue, confusion, and unintended behaviors
	* Build Prototype v2 that responds to failure
* Design Autopsy:
	* What did users do "wrong"?
	* What did you not change, and why?

##### Week 3 - Constrain Intervention
* Goal: Force lateral thinking
* Pick 2 of the following constrains:
	* Remove a key material
	* Reduce size by 50%
	* Make it operable with one hand
	* Remove it's "main" feature
* Assignment
	* Build Prototype v3
* Design Autopsy:
	* Which contraint helped?
	* Which broke your idea?
	* What emerged unexpectedly?

##### Week 4 - Reframing the Object
* Goal: Transition from object to system
* Assignment:
	Reframe the object:
		* is it training someone?
		* is it enforcing value?
		* is it revealing a system?
	Build Prototype v4 OR deliberately stop iterating and justify why?
#### Week 5 - Process Review (Not a Final)
* Deliverables:
	* Physical prototype (any version)
	* Process Documentation (photos, sketches, notes)
	* Final Design Autopsy: What did this object teach me about my thinking process?

# Failure-Forward Grading Rubric

Total: 100 points

1. Iteration & Risk (30 pts)
	* 27–30: Multiple substantial iterations; student actively changed direction based on failure
	* 20–26: Iterations present but mostly refinements
	* 10–19: Minimal change; avoided risk
	* 0–9: Single-solution mindset
	
2. Engagement with Failure (25 pts)

	* 22–25: Failures clearly identified, analyzed, and used productively
	* 15–21: Failure acknowledged but not deeply examined
	* 8–14: Failure reframed as “mistake” rather than insight

3. Process Documentation (20 pts)

	* 18–20: Clear visual and written documentation of thinking over time
	* 12–17: Documentation present but incomplete
	* 6–11: Minimal documentation
	* 0–5: Little to no process evidence
	* 0–7: Failure avoided or hidden

4. Conceptual Clarity (15 pts)

	* 13–15: Object clearly explores a question, behavior, or idea
	* 9–12: Concept present but underdeveloped
	* 4–8: Concept unclear
	* 0–3: No articulated intent

5. Reflection Quality (10 pts)

	* 9–10: Thoughtful, honest, specific
	* 6–8: General but sincere
	* 3–5: Surface-level
	* 0–2: Minimal or absent
