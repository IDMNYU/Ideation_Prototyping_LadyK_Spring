### DM-UY 1143 Ideation and Prototyping


# Process Website


Documentation of your creative process is an integral part of your creative work; it records the many steps in the creation of a work. This is important because process documentation:

* allows you to review and reflect on the iterative journey of your ideas and their physical manifestations over time
* can often be the catalyst for future projects that derive from some unexplored thread in the original idea
* captures previous points in the life of a creative work that you may need to go back to if the chosen direction does not prove successful
* provides ample material with which to communicate to a public audience the narrative of your work, the evolution of your ideas, and the morphology of materials and forms

With this in mind, throughout the duration of the semester each student must carefully document ALL of the work created in this class, from brainstorming sessions with post-it notes to pages in a sketchbook to rough prototypes. You will post this documentation on your process website on a daily or weekly basis. **All posts must be timestamped and not backdated. Previous dates will not be reviewed**

* Each weekly post must include one sentence identifying how you responded to feedback from the previous week.

The process website is especially important for documenting your Constant Input/Output assignment. How you organize your site is up you, but you may wish to create a separate page for each assignment, or use the blog function for Constant Input, and use site pages for other assignments. 


* Create a dedicated wordpress via [http://wp.nyu.edu](http://wp.nyu.edu) for this class only.

* Alternatively create a **ip** directory if you already have server space of your own via an ISP (Internet Service Provider), and install wordpress in that directory.

For the steps of setting up a wordpress site via NYU: See the slide deck in Slack under "slides."
