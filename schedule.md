# Schedule

	_How to Read This Schedule_

	This schedule outlines the arc of the course, not a checklist to be completed. Many assignments and projects span multiple weeks and are assessed based on _week-to-week development_, not completion alone.

	Each week builds on the previous one. You are expected to show _visible movement, iteration, and decision-making_ from week to week. Work that appears rushed, compressed, or unchanged from earlier weeks will not receive satisfactory evaluation.

	This is a _process-based course_. You cannot “catch up” by completing multiple weeks of work at once.

	GitHub and Slack are the official sources for all assignments, deadlines, and updates.

	This schedule may evolve in response to the pace and needs of the class.

_GitHub and Slack are the official sources for all assignments, deadlines, and updates_.

__Most readings and exercises are meant to influence ongoing projects. You are expected to reference and apply them beyond the week they are assigned__.

Reading & Reflection

Read:

Rohde, Sketching: the Visual Thinking Power Tool

Brown, The Miseducation of the Doodle

Post a reflection responding to one article (not a summary). Focus on what challenged or resonated with you and why.

Process Work

Create a dense, exploratory mind map connected to your Constant I/O project. This should demonstrate range, curiosity, and associative thinking.

Write a reflection exploring:

Interests from childhood

Long-standing fascinations

Topics you return to in daydreaming or play
(This reflection establishes personal input streams for your Constant I/O project.)

This week establishes your baseline. Depth and range matter more than clarity.

**If a week shows no meaningful development from the previous week, that week will be evaluated as below satisfactory regardless of effort.**
