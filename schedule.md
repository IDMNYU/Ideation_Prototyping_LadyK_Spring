### DM-UY 1143 Ideation and Prototyping
##### Spring 2026 • Katherine Bennett • Mon/Wed 2:00-3:50 • In-person room 309 @ 370 Jay Street

# Schedule
##### How to Read This Schedule

	This schedule outlines the arc of the course, not a checklist to be completed. Many assignments and projects span multiple weeks and are assessed based on _week-to-week development_, not completion alone.

	Weekly work is evaluated relative to the previous week. Stagnation counts as non-submission.

	This is a _process-based course_. You cannot “catch up” by completing multiple weeks of work at once.

	* GitHub and Slack are the official sources for all assignments, deadlines, and updates.

	* This schedule may evolve in response to the pace and needs of the class.

__Most readings and exercises are meant to influence ongoing projects. You are expected to reference and apply them beyond the week they are assigned__.

__If a week of posts shows no meaningful development from the previous week, that week will be evaluated as below satisfactory regardless of effort.__

__Each weekly post must include one sentence identifying how you responded to feedback from the previous week (if you received feedback from anyone).__

<strong><u>Setup & Orientation</u></strong>

* [Join Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/ideationproto-jez5636/shared_invite/zt-3np31qu9i-_HYODEdVsk0yuVGV6MPWww)

* Acquire sketchbook and required drawing tools

* Complete course survey <a href= ""> </a>

* Obtain Show Your Work by Austin Kleon and begin reading

<strong>Reading & Reflection</strong>

* <a href ="<a href = https://alistapart.com/article/sketching-the-visual-thinking-power-tool">Rohde, Sketching: the Visual Thinking Power Tool</a>

* <a href = "https://alistapart.com/article/the-miseducation-of-the-doodle">Brown, The Miseducation of the Doodle </a>

* Post a reflection responding to the articles (not a summary). Focus on what challenged or resonated with you and why.

<strong>Process Work</strong>

* Create a dense, exploratory <a href = "assignmentBriefs/mindMaps.md">mind map </a> regarding yourself, interests and background. This should demonstrate range, curiosity, and associative thinking. Ideally do this on a white board or digital surface or using Miro.

* Write a reflection exploring:

	* Interests from childhood

	* Long-standing fascinations

	* Topics you return to in daydreaming or play
(This reflection establishes personal input streams for project topics for the semester.)
