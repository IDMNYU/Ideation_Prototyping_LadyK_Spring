# Schedule

	_How to Read This Schedule_

	This schedule outlines the arc of the course, not a checklist to be completed. Many assignments and projects span multiple weeks and are assessed based on _week-to-week development_, not completion alone.

	Each week builds on the previous one. You are expected to show _visible movement, iteration, and decision-making_ from week to week. Work that appears rushed, compressed, or unchanged from earlier weeks will not receive satisfactory evaluation.

	This is a _process-based course_. You cannot “catch up” by completing multiple weeks of work at once.

	GitHub and Slack are the official sources for all assignments, deadlines, and updates.

	This schedule may evolve in response to the pace and needs of the class.

_GitHub and Slack are the official sources for all assignments, deadlines, and updates_.

__Most readings and exercises are meant to influence ongoing projects. You are expected to reference and apply them beyond the week they are assigned__.
