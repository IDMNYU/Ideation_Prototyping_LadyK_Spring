Frequently Asked Questions


Why can’t I just go with my first idea if it works?

	Because in this course, your first idea is treated as data, not an answer. First ideas are often familiar, unexamined, or shaped by defaults. The goal is to explore alternatives so you can make intentional decisions rather than convenient ones.

Why do we have to do exercises like mind-mapping or reframing?

	These exercises are tools for expanding your thinking and exposing assumptions. They are not busywork. You may not see their value immediately—but they often change how you think about your project rather than what you make.

What if my project doesn’t “work” in the end?

	* That is not a problem. Execution issues or failed experiments are not penalized. What matters is whether you:

	* Took risks

	* Iterated

	* Engaged with feedback

	* Analyzed what happened

Unsuccessful outcomes are acceptable. Unexamined decisions are not.

How much does polish matter?

	Polish matters far less than process.  A highly polished project that shows little exploration will receive a lower grade than a rough project that demonstrates growth, iteration, and strong thinking.

Why do we need to document process on a website?

	The process site makes your thinking visible—to you, your peers, and the instructor. It allows us to see:

		* How ideas evolved

		* What was tried and abandoned

		* How feedback and research influenced decisions

	Learning happens in the middle, not just at the end.

What does “participation” actually mean in this class?

	Participation includes:

		* Being present and engaged in class

		* Asking questions

		* Giving meaningful feedback to peers

		* Contributing to discussions and critiques

	Participation is not passive. If you are silent and disengaged, you are not fully participating—even if you submit assignments.

Why do we have to give peer feedback?

	Learning to critique is a core skill. Giving feedback helps you:

		* See patterns across projects

		* Develop critical judgment

		* Reflect on your own work through others’ work

	Your ability to give thoughtful feedback is graded.

Can I use AI tools for writing reflections or process documentation?

	AI can assist with grammar or organization, but reflections must be grounded in your specific decisions, struggles, and experiences. Generic or polished writing that lacks specificity will not receive full credit.

	Messy thinking is expected. Overly polished writing is not required.

What if I feel lost or behind?

	Feeling lost is normal in a process-based course. Talk to the instructor early. Questions, confusion, and uncertainty are part of the work—but they need to be communicated.

What does success look like in this course?

	Success looks like:

		* Trying things that don’t work

		* Learning from feedback

		* Taking risks you wouldn’t normally take

		* Showing growth over time

		* Becoming more comfortable with uncertainty

Is this class supposed to be hard?

	Yes—but not in the traditional sense. It is challenging because it asks you to think differently, question assumptions, and resist rushing to answers.
