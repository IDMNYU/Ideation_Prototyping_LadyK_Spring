# Future Project 

### 20% of Final Grade

The Future Project is a semester-long speculative design project that asks you to imagine a future world 100–200 years from now and to develop it through research, iteration, and material exploration.

This project is not about prediction. It is about plausible speculation—using research, systems thinking, and imagination to explore how present-day forces might unfold over time.

This document provides an overview of the project. Refer to the course schedule and weekly briefs for how this project is developed incrementally through required exercises. These exercises are not optional add-ons; they are the mechanism through which the project gains depth.

## Project Premise

Imagine a future in which society has either:

collapsed beyond repair, or

reorganized into a radically different—but internally coherent—system

Through a fictional rupture in time, you are able to send a piece of information, knowledge, or material culture back to the present.

Your task is to design that future world and communicate it through:

	systems

	narratives

	artifacts

	and consequences

The future you create must be wildly imaginative, but it must also be plausible in some form.

Form means that your world can be traced through a succession of understandable forces, decisions, and events.

If your future includes elements that feel fantastical (e.g., “magic,” radical technologies, or unknown forces), you are expected to ground them in research, metaphor, or speculative logic. As Hans Vaihinger argues in The Philosophy of As If, the ideal operates as a practical fiction—useful because it behaves as though it were real.

## Part 1: Concept Development (Foundation Phase)

In this phase, you will establish the conceptual and research foundation for your future world.

You are expected to demonstrate extended effort—moving well beyond first ideas and familiar futures.

Required Evidence (Posted to your Process Site under “Future Project”)

* Mind maps showing breadth, divergence, and evolution

* Brainstorming and exploration using at least 4 of the following methods:

	* How Might We…

	Statement Starters

	5 Whys

	Assumptions

	Bad Idea / Reverse Brainstorming

	Creative Matrix

	5WH
(You must demonstrate the Extended Effort Principle.)

* Research evidence, integrated into your thinking (not listed as decoration), including:

	Articles, books, journals

	News, podcasts, films

	UMD methods and documentation

* Assumption maps

* Mood boards

This phase establishes the logic, tensions, and questions that drive the rest of the project.

## Part 2:

You will develop this world and project through the following assignments over the next several weeks:

World & System Development (Iterative Phase)

Over the following weeks, you will develop your future world through structured assignments that build on one another. These components are interdependent and should clearly influence one another.

Required elements include (as developed across the semester):

	Expanded mood boards and mind maps (as needed)

	Concept maps

	User personas

	Stakeholder analysis

	Assumptions list

	Newspaper front page (future snapshot)

	Problem statement ideation

	Documented research development using UMD methods

	Future object / artifact - low & higher fidelity

	Timeline of events leading to the future condition

	Annotated bibliography demonstrating diversity of sources for both topic & category research

	Storyboard (see Slack for resources)

Your work should show visible evolution across weeks. Static or repetitive submissions indicate insufficient engagement with process.

Part 3: Final Narrative & Presentation

15% of Final Course Grade

For the final, you will inhabit the future you created.

You will develop:

	A narrative framework for your world

	A creative presentation method that communicates that world and your artifact

You may not present as yourself. You must present as someone from within the future you designed (e.g., citizen, historian, technician, archivist).

This presentation must itself go through:

	brainstorming

	prototyping

	research

	iteration

The goal is not performance polish, but conceptual coherence and clarity of communication.

Future Project Grading Rubric

This rubric evaluates the trajectory of your work, not isolated deliverables. A polished final outcome does not compensate for weak process. Strong process can compensate for imperfect outcomes.

	 1. ####Process & Iteration (35%)

		* Clear week-to-week development

		* Evidence of extended effort beyond first ideas

		* Meaningful pivots, refinements, and re-framing

		* Visible response to feedback

High: Work evolves substantially across time
Low: Work remains static or superficially altered

2. Research Integration & Plausibility (25%)

	* Research meaningfully shapes decisions

	* Sources are diverse, relevant, and critically engaged

	* Speculative elements are grounded in logic or systems

High: Research transforms the world-building
Low: Research is decorative or disconnected

3. Conceptual Depth & Systems Thinking (20%)

	* Future world demonstrates internal logic

	* Ethical, social, or systemic consequences are considered

	* Relationships between people, systems, and artifacts are clear

High: World feels complex and lived-in
Low: World relies on clichés or naïve futurism

4. Artifact & Material Exploration (10%)

	* Artifact meaningfully emerges from the world

	* Prototyping shows exploration, not just execution

	* Form supports narrative and system logic

5. Communication & Documentation (10%)

	* Process Site is clear, annotated, and navigable

	* Reflections articulate decisions and uncertainties

	* Final presentation communicates the world effectively
