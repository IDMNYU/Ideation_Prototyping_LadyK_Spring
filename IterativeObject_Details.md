# Iterative Object Project Details

Project brief topics for [Iterative Object Project](../IterativeObjectProject.md)

#### The Useless-but-Revealing Object
* Purpose: Break optimization instince + introduce "why does this exist?"
* Prompt: Design and Prototype an object that:
	* Solves a non-problem
	* Or makes an existing problem _slightly_ worse
	* Or reveals a hidden behavior or habit
* Examples:
	* a mug that forces you to drink slower
	* a backpack that subtly rearranges its contents
	* a device that over-explains simple decisions
	* a door handle that asks permission before oopenting
* Constraints:
	* Max 3 materials
	* Must involve at least one physical interaction
	* Must be rebuildable in under 30 minutes

#### The Emotional Machine
* Purpose: Shift from Technical Function to experiential function. Observe how people _misuse_ or _misinterpret it_
* Prompt: Create a physical object that:
	* Produces or responds to an emotion
	* Has no screen
	* Has no explicit instructions
* Possible emotional targeets
	* mild anxiety
	* comfort
	* anticipation
	* guilt
	* relief
* Examples
	* An object that rewards waiting
	* A device that sighs when picked up
	* A box that resists being opened unless you calm down
* Design Autopsy Requirement: What emotion did you think you were designing for, and what emotions did user actually feel?

#### The Object That Trains You
* Purpose: Introduce behavior-shaping systems
* Prompt
	Prototype and object that (all 3):
		* Tries to change a small human behavior
		* Has no digital Feedbaack
		* Is mildy annoying but not punitive
* Behavior Examples:
	* Standing up straighter
	* Drinking water
	* Not checking your phone
	* Leaving on time
* Important Twist:
	* First prototype must not work
	* Second prototype responds to observed failure
